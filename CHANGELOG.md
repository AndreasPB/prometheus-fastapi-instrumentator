## [Unreleased]

* Nothing.

## [1.3.0] 2020-08-12

### Added

* Option `should_respect_env_var_existence`. 
    * This makes it possible to only instrument and expose your FastAPI if a 
        given environment variable is set. 
    * Usecase: A base FastAPI app that is used by multiple distinct apps. The 
        apps only have to set the variable to be instrumented.
    * Deactivated by default and the default env var is `PROMETHEUS`.

## [1.2.0] 2020-08-06

### Added

* The observed latency values can now be rounded to a certain number of 
    decimals as an opt-in feature. This can improve bytes per sample required in 
    storage solutions like VictoriaMetrics.

## [1.1.1] 2020-07-19

* Nothing

## [1.1.0] 2020-07-16

### Changed

* Renamed project from *Prometheus FastAPI Exporter* to 
    *Prometheus FastAPI Instrumentator*. Reasoning behind this change: Focus of 
    this project is the instrumentation, not exposition of metrics.

## [1.0.2] 2020-07-15

### Changed

* Updated README.md

## [1.0.1] 2020-07-15

### Changed

* Updated README.md

## [1.0.0] 2020-07-15

### Added

* Explicit method to expose metrics by adding endpoint to an FastAPI app.
* This changelog document.

### Changed

* Switch to SemVer versioning.
* Split instrumentation and exposition into two parts. Why? There exist many 
    ways to expose metrics. Now this package enables the instrumentation of 
    FastAPI without enforcing a certain method of exposition. It is still 
    possible with the new method `expose()`.
* Moved pass of FastAPI object from constructor to `instrument()` method.
* Extended testing.

### Removed

* Exposition of metrics endpoint from `Ã¬nstrument()` call.
* Contribution document. No need for it.
